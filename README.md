# Building-with-Backgrounds-and-Gradients
This project consists of building a webpage using images as a background and adding gradients to elements. The goal is to make a clone of old an old version of the Apple website webpage.

I used the guidelines from the [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org) curriculum, as well as [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) for this project.

## Getting Started

This is just a clone page. You can click some of the elements and view the page, but nothing will work because it's only for showcasing.
